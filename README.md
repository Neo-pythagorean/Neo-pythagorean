- 👋🏻 Hi, I’m @xorterian from Budapest!
- 👀 I’m interested in fractals, multi-valued logics, anaglyphs, data science/ML (DNNs, ANNs based on non-linear perceptrons), complexity theory, tetration and functional equations, etc.
- 👨🏻‍🎓 I've graduated in Computer Science BSc (the title of my diploma thesis was Functional completeness of many-valued logics and its applications).
- 🧠 I studied a semester in Biomedical Engineer MSc (my laboratory work was about BCIs mostly about processing its data based on AI).
- 🧮 I hope I will have been studying Applied Mathematics MSc in the future.
- 🌱 I’m currently looking for job related to my diploma.
